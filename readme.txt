into your WordPress dashboard, giving you AI assistance without leaving the editor.

**Features:**

* **Chat assistant** — Conversational AI with tool support (read posts, search content)
* **Content generator** — Generate full blog posts with customisable tone and length
* **Usage tracker** — Monitor API usage and token consumption across providers

**External services:** This plugin sends content you submit to the AI provider of your choice

chosen provider. Review each provider's privacy policy and terms of service before use:
