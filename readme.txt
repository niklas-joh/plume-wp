* **Content generator** — Generate full blog posts with customisable tone and length
* **AI SEO** — Generate meta titles, descriptions, excerpts, and image alt text

  sent directly to your chosen provider — never through Plume's managed
  service.

**Supported AI providers:** Anthropic Claude, OpenAI (GPT-4+), Google Gemini, Ollama (local/self-hosted)

**External services:** This plugin sends content you submit to the AI provider of your choice
(Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google). Your content leaves your server and is processed by the
chosen provider. Review each provider's privacy policy and terms of service before use:

* Anthropic: https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy
* OpenAI: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
* Google Gemini: https://policies.google.com/privacy
* Ollama is self-hosted; no external transmission occurs when using Ollama.
* **Plume AI - Write and Design** (`https://plume-proxy.plume.workers.dev`): Free and managed-pro
  tiers route chat requests through this service. The service receives your
  site URL (for registration) and the chat messages you send. No messages are stored
  beyond the in-flight API call. See: https://wpaimind.com/privacy-policy

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plume` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. (Optional — Pro BYOK only) Navigate to **Plume AI - Write and Design → Settings** and enter your own API key. Free and managed-plan users do not need an API key.
4. Start using the Chat, Generator, or Usage modules from the admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which AI providers are supported? =

Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI (GPT-4 and above), Google Gemini, and Ollama. You can configure
one or more providers and switch between them in the settings.

= Does this plugin store my API keys securely? =

**Free / Pro Managed tiers:** No API key is required — chat requests are routed
through Plume AI - Write and Design (see External services above). Your messages are
forwarded to Claude (Anthropic) on your behalf.

**Pro BYOK tier:** Your own API key is stored encrypted (AES-256-CBC) in the WordPress
database and is transmitted directly to the AI provider you have chosen. It is never sent
to any other server.

= Is this plugin GDPR-compliant? =

The plugin transmits content you submit to Plume AI - Write and Design and/or the AI
provider you have configured (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini). Both the service and
the AI provider receive your chat messages. You are responsible for ensuring that
transmission is compliant with your applicable data protection regulations. Consider adding
the Plume AI - Write and Design privacy policy and your chosen provider's data processing agreement to your
privacy documentation.

= What WordPress roles can use the AI features? =

Users with the `edit_posts` capability (Authors, Editors, Administrators) can use the
content generation tools. Site settings require `manage_options` (Administrators only).

== Changelog ==

= NEXT_VERSION =
* **All features are now available on every tier.** Chat, Generator, SEO, and Images are no longer locked behind Pro — every site gets full access to all four modules from the moment you install or update.
* **Usage is now measured in credits, not tokens.** Each AI action (a chat turn, a generated draft, an SEO suggestion, an image) costs a small number of credits depending on the model used. Your plan determines how many credits you get each month and which models you can choose from — not which features you can use.
* **Free** now includes 100 credits/month, with access to Claude Haiku 4.5 and GPT-4.1 nano.
* **Pro Managed** ($79/year) now includes 500 credits/month, plus access to larger models — Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 3.1 Pro — for higher-quality results on demanding tasks.
* **Pro BYOK** is unchanged: connect your own API key and get unlimited usage with no credit ceiling, billed directly by your provider.
* The 30-day trial has been removed. There's no longer a time-boxed "all features unlocked" period to track, because every tier already has full feature access — a trial no longer has anything distinct left to offer.
* Removed: the public-facing `[plume_chat]` shortcode and front-end chat widget module. This does not affect the in-editor SEO panel or admin-side Chat, Generator, Images, or SEO tools, which are unaffected and unlocked for all tiers as above.
