# WP AI Mind — Architecture Overhaul: Master Tracking Document

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace the Freemius-gated, user-API-key model with a thin-client JWT/proxy architecture. Free/trial users route through a Cloudflare Worker proxy; Pro users retain their own API keys; all enforcement lives server-side.

**Architecture:** The WordPress plugin becomes a UI-only thin client storing a JWT and rendering entitlement-aware UI. A Cloudflare Worker handles authentication (email+password with PBKDF2, JWT issuance), plan enforcement (Cloudflare KV rate limits), and proxies requests to Anthropic. User accounts live in Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). Payments handled via LemonSqueezy webhooks updating D1 directly.

**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript), Cloudflare D1 (SQLite), Cloudflare KV, Wrangler CLI, Web Crypto API (HMAC-SHA256 JWTs, PBKDF2 passwords), LemonSqueezy, PHP 8.1+ (WordPress plugin), React/JSX (@wordpress/element), @wordpress/api-fetch.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| User account storage | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) | Co-located with Worker; zero extra infra; free at low volume |
| Password hashing | PBKDF2-SHA256, 100k iterations | bcrypt unavailable in Web Crypto API; PBKDF2 is the standard alternative |
| JWT implementation | HMAC-SHA256 via Web Crypto API | No external library deps; native in CF Workers |
| Token storage (WP) | `wp_options` for both tokens | Consistent with existing ProviderSettings pattern. **Design constraint: one NJ account per WordPress site** — all WP users share the same token; `POST /nj/logout` ends the session site-wide. Intentional for single-owner installs; see phase-2 Risk Notes for multi-user migration path. |
| Entitlement caching | 1-hour WP transient | Matches JWT expiry window; balances freshness vs HTTP overhead |
| Proxy routing | `ProxyProvider` implements `ProviderInterface` | Plugs into existing provider pattern; zero changes to ChatRestController |
| `nj_resolve_provider()` | Global function loaded eagerly | Same pattern as `wp_ai_mind_is_pro()` was; available to all code |
| Trial → Free demotion | Happens at token-request time in Worker | No cron needed; transparently enforced on next login |
| Free user model | Claude Haiku via shared proxy key | Cheapest capable model; qualitative upgrade incentive |
| Pro routing | Direct to provider (own key), bypasses Worker | Worker pays nothing for Pro usage |
| LemonSqueezy integration | Webhooks update D1 plan directly | No Freemius dependency; EU VAT handled; clean webhooks |
| UsageLogger removal | Delete entirely; KV is the source of truth | Logging in plugin can be bypassed; Worker KV is authoritative |
| `ProGate` replacement | `nj_feature( $key )` helper + `NJ_Entitlement::feature()` | Drop-in replacement at all 13 call sites |
| Freemius removal trigger | After Phase 4 is in production | Pro users must have migrated before old gate is removed |

## Critical Files to Understand Before Modifying

| File | Phase | Why It Matters |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `wp-ai-mind.php:25-101` | 5 | Freemius bootstrap + `wam_fs()` — entire block removed in Phase 5 |
| `includes/Core/ProGate.php` | 5 | 13 call sites; global `wp_ai_mind_is_pro()` — all replaced in Phase 5 |
| `includes/DB/UsageLogger.php` | 5 | Removed in Phase 5; `maybe_log()` in AbstractProvider removed in Phase 4 |
| `includes/Providers/AbstractProvider.php` | 4 | `maybe_log()` call removed in Phase 4; do not change `with_retry()` |
| `includes/Providers/ProviderFactory.php` | 4 | `make_default()` and `make()` both need `nj_resolve_provider()` integration |
| `includes/Modules/Seo/SeoModule.php:63-90` | 5 | Representative of all 4 gated `permission_callback` lambdas to update |
| `includes/DB/Schema.php:31-50` | 5 | `wpaim_usage_log` table — removed in Phase 5; add `maybe_migrate()` |
| `src/admin/index.js` | 6 | Entry point for auth gate wrapping in Phase 6 |
| `src/admin/settings/ProvidersTab.jsx` | 6 | API key inputs conditionally hidden in Phase 6 |
| `composer.json` | 5 | Freemius SDK removed in Phase 5 |

## Phase Summaries

### Phase 1 — CF Worker: Auth + D1 Foundation
**Duration estimate:** 1–2 weeks · **Scope:** Greenfield `wp-ai-mind-proxy/` TypeScript project.

Creates the Cloudflare Worker project from scratch. Implements user registration, login, token refresh, and entitlement endpoint. Nothing in the WordPress plugin changes. Phases 2 and 3 are **blocked** until this is deployed to Cloudflare.

**Key deliverables:**
- `wp-ai-mind-proxy/` project with Wrangler config
- D1 `users` table migration
- `POST /v1/auth/register` — creates trial account (7-day `plan_expires`)
- `POST /v1/auth/token` — verifies password, returns JWT pair, demotes expired trials
- `POST /v1/auth/refresh` — returns new access token
- `GET /v1/entitlement` — returns plan, features, token usage
- All unit tests passing (Vitest)

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-1-cf-worker-foundation.md](phases/phase-1-cf-worker-foundation.md)

---

### Phase 2 — PHP: Auth + Entitlement Layer
**Duration estimate:** 1 week · **Scope:** New PHP classes only; ProGate remains unchanged.

Adds `NJ_Auth` and `NJ_Entitlement` PHP classes and REST endpoints so WordPress can authenticate against the Worker. ProGate and Freemius continue to function — both systems coexist during this phase.

**Key deliverables:**
- `includes/Auth/NJ_Auth.php` — JWT storage, proactive refresh
- `includes/Entitlement/NJ_Entitlement.php` — 1h transient cache, null-object fallback
- `includes/Admin/NJAuthRestController.php` — `/nj/login`, `/nj/register`, `/nj/logout`, `/nj/me`
- `nj_feature()` global helper in `wp-ai-mind.php`
- Localized `isAuthenticated` + `entitlement` data on all admin pages

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-2-php-auth-entitlement.md](phases/phase-2-php-auth-entitlement.md)

---

### Phase 3 — CF Worker: Chat + LemonSqueezy Webhooks
**Duration estimate:** 1 week · **Scope:** Worker only; no PHP changes. Runs in parallel with Phase 2.

Replaces the 501 stub `handleChat` and `handleLemonSqueezy` functions from Phase 1 with real implementations. Free/trial users are limited by KV token counters. LemonSqueezy webhook sets `plan='pro'` in D1.

**Key deliverables:**
- `POST /v1/chat` — enforces KV limits, proxies to Anthropic, updates KV usage
- `POST /webhooks/lemonsqueezy` — HMAC verification, D1 plan updates
- Vitest tests for both handlers

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-3-cf-worker-chat-webhooks.md](phases/phase-3-cf-worker-chat-webhooks.md)

---

### Phase 4 — PHP: ProxyProvider + ProviderFactory Routing
**Duration estimate:** 1 week · **Scope:** New PHP classes + targeted modifications to 3 existing files.

Free/trial users transparently route through `ProxyProvider` → Worker. Pro users continue using direct providers unchanged. `nj_resolve_provider()` is the single routing decision point. `AbstractProvider::maybe_log()` removed (KV is the source of truth now).

**Key deliverables:**
- `includes/Proxy/NJ_Proxy_Client.php` — wraps Worker `/v1/chat` call
- `includes/Providers/ProxyProvider.php` — implements `ProviderInterface`
- `nj_resolve_provider()` global function
- `ProviderFactory::make_default()` delegates to `nj_resolve_provider()`
- `AbstractProvider` — `maybe_log()` removed

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-4-php-proxy-routing.md](phases/phase-4-php-proxy-routing.md)

---

### Phase 5 — PHP: Freemius Removal + Full Cleanup
**Duration estimate:** 1 week · **Scope:** Delete dead code; replace all 13 ProGate call sites.

⚠️ **Deploy Phase 4 to production before starting this phase.** Existing Pro users must have migrated to NJ accounts before the old gate is removed. Migration notice is shown to unauthenticated users.

**Key deliverables:**
- `ProGate.php` deleted; `wp_ai_mind_is_pro()` replaced at 13 call sites with `nj_feature()`
- `UsageLogger.php` deleted
- Freemius SDK removed from `composer.json` + `vendor/`
- `wam_fs()` block removed from `wp-ai-mind.php`
- `Schema::maybe_migrate()` drops `wpaim_usage_log` table
- All 5 grep-clean checks must pass

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-5-php-legacy-removal.md](phases/phase-5-php-legacy-removal.md)

---

### Phase 6 — React: Auth UI + Usage Components
**Duration estimate:** 1–2 weeks · **Scope:** New React components; modifications to existing React apps.

All React admin apps are wrapped in `AuthProvider`. Unauthenticated users see a login/signup form instead of the AI interface. `UsageMeter` and `UsageWarning` appear on all AI pages. `UpgradeModal` shown on any 429 response. `ProvidersTab` hides API key inputs for non-Pro users.

**Key deliverables:**
- `src/admin/auth/` — `AuthContext.jsx`, `AuthApp.jsx`, `LoginForm.jsx`, `SignupForm.jsx`
- `src/admin/shared/` — `UsageMeter.jsx`, `UpgradeModal.jsx`, `UsageWarning.jsx`, `constants.js`
- `src/admin/index.js` — auth gate wrapping all roots
- `ProvidersTab.jsx` — conditional API key section

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-6-react-auth-ui.md](phases/phase-6-react-auth-ui.md)

---

### Phase 7 — CF Worker: Hardening
**Duration estimate:** 1–2 weeks · **Scope:** Worker only; can start any time after Phase 3.

Adds brute-force rate limiting on auth endpoints, real SSE streaming via `TransformStream`, multi-provider routing (OpenAI + Gemini), structured JSON error logging, and a staging environment in `wrangler.toml`.

**Key deliverables:**
- `src/ratelimit.ts` — 10 attempts / 15 min per IP via KV
- `src/providers/` — `anthropic.ts`, `openai.ts`, `gemini.ts`, `types.ts`
- `chat.ts` — provider routing + `TransformStream` passthrough for `stream:true`
- `wrangler.toml` — `[env.staging]` block
- Vitest tests passing; smoke test confirming rate limit at attempt 11

**Acceptance criteria:** See [phase-7-cf-worker-hardening.md](phases/phase-7-cf-worker-hardening.md)

## Testing Strategy Per Phase

| Phase | Unit Tests | Integration / E2E |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | `wp-ai-mind-proxy/test/*.test.ts` (Vitest) | curl smoke tests against workers.dev |
| 2 | `tests/Unit/Auth/`, `tests/Unit/Entitlement/` | Playwright: login flow on localhost:8080 |
| 3 | `wp-ai-mind-proxy/test/chat.test.ts`, `webhooks.test.ts` | curl: `POST /v1/chat` with test JWT |
| 4 | `tests/Unit/Proxy/`, `tests/Unit/Providers/ProxyProviderTest.php` | Playwright: chat as free-tier user |
| 5 | All existing Unit tests must still pass; `ProGateTest.php` deleted | `phpcs` + `phpunit` full suite |
| 6 | Manual browser verification (no unit tests for React UI) | Visual + flow testing in browser |
| 7 | `wp-ai-mind-proxy/test/ratelimit.test.ts`, `streaming.test.ts` | curl rate limit + stream smoke tests |

## Final Verification Checklist

Run these checks before declaring the overhaul complete.

### Grep clean checks (must return zero matches)
- [ ] `grep -r "wp_ai_mind_is_pro" .` — no matches
- [ ] `grep -r "wam_fs" .` — no matches
- [ ] `grep -r "ProGate" .` — no matches
- [ ] `grep -r "UsageLogger" .` — no matches
- [ ] `grep -r "freemius" vendor/` — no matches (directory should not exist)

### Build checks
- [ ] `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/ --colors=always` — all pass
- [ ] `./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml.dist` — no errors
- [ ] `npm run build` — no errors
- [ ] `npx vitest run` (in `wp-ai-mind-proxy/`) — all pass

### E2E flow checks
- [ ] Login → free chat → see UsageMeter → hit 429 → see UpgradeModal
- [ ] Pro user → chat → routes direct (no Worker involvement, verify via network log)
- [ ] Logout → auth card shown, not AI interface
- [ ] D1 `users` table exists with correct schema (check via Cloudflare dashboard or `wrangler d1 execute`)
- [ ] LemonSqueezy test webhook delivery → D1 plan updates to `pro`
- [ ] JWT expiry: wait for access token to expire → refresh path exercises silently on next request
- [ ] Rate limiting: 11 rapid login attempts from same IP → 429 on attempt 11
